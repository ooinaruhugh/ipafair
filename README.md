IPAFAIR: Reentrant Incremental Argumentation Framework API
==========================================================

This repository contains C and Python versions of IPAFAIR, an incremental API
for argumentation framework (AF) solvers. In particular, IPAFAIR allows for
constructing an AF and solving standard reasoning tasks, such as credulous and
skeptical acceptance under most widely studied AF semantics, and applying
dynamic changes (additions and deletions of arguments and attacks) to the AF
between acceptance queries.

See `ipafair.h` and `ipafair.py` for the C and Python versions, respectively.

See `example` for a usage example.
